the btc quantitative analysis test is only a test, is very much probable has many mistakes, btw both random walk and montecarlo 
simulations are not correct.
the code has been taken mostly from python finance and portfolio management from data camp.
the data is from binance and come through api request
i can only extract btc data, so cannot do anything concerning portfolio management.
